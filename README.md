# 🛡️ GRC Enterprise Simulation Lab

### 🚀 About This Project
Welcome to my personal GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) laboratory. 

As a Cybersecurity professional transitioning into the GRC space, I believe that **theory without practice is just potential.** While preparing for my **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** and **Microsoft SC-900** certifications, I created this environment to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application.

### 🎯 Objective
This repository documents a continuous, simulated audit and compliance cycle for **5 fictional companies** spanning different industries. The goal is to apply international standards (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, HIPAA) to solve "real" business problems, document risks, and propose remediation strategies.
